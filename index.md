# Citi Bike Project                                           
### The Bronx

##### Introduction
Each of these individual sites represents a group member's work on a specific neighborhood in the Bronx and explains he CitiBike stations that they proposed and why they proposed them. Each team member conducted their own individual research on their respective neighborhood, and used GeoJson to create a map with color coded markers for their first and second choices for CitiBike loctions within a 1,000 square foot grid. Together, they cover the South Bronx neighborhoods and what CitiBike expansion may look like.

##### Mott Haven
* Mott Haven is a residential neighborhood in the South Bronx area. 
* Proposed station locations were placed near major avenues and streets (3rd Ave), train stations, parks, green areas, and hospitals.
* Citibike service in the neighborhood would grant a more eceonomically viable mode of transportation for residents.

* Mott Haven has a total population of 52,413; ~72.3% Latinx, ~24.7 Black, ~1.7% White, ~0.8% Other, ~0.4% Asian, 0.2% Native American.

* Citibikes in Mott Haven would provide a cost effective mode of transportation in areas which lack reliable or affordable service.
* Mott Haven has minimal public transport, with only a single train line accessible. 
* Bikes allow for easier movement towards connections, hence the placement of stations near public transport pick up/dropoff points.

##### Morrisania
* Morrisania is a primarily working class residential neighborhood in the South Bronx.
* Proposed Citibike locations were generally placed near concentrated residential areas, education centers, clusters of private businesses, public services and recreational activities.
* The introduction of Citibike service to Morrisania would reduce reliance on private automobiles and encourage the use of public transportation.

* Morrisania has a total population of 73,263.
* Of this population, ~53% of residents are female, ~47% are male. The majority of residents are Black or African American (~45%); followed by ~ Some Other Race, ~10% White, ~2.7% Two or More Races, ~0.8 Native American or Alaska Native, and ~0.5 Asian.
* The majority of residents are middle-aged (35-65 years old), however, the age distribution places similarly sized populations within all age groups other than 65 and Above. Of all residents: ~31% are Under 18 Years, ~26% are 18 to 34 Years, ~35% are 35 to 64 Years, and ~8% are 65 and Above. 
* The majority of adults have only recieved Some High School as their highest form of formal education. A slightly smaller number of adults have recieved a High School Diploma (or Equivalent) or Some College (or Associate's Degree).
* Morriania covers 148 acres of land.

* CitiBikes in Morrisania would reduce commuter wait-times, allow for a cheaper and more enviromentially-friendly alternative mode of transportation and reduce congestion along bus lines in more congested areas.
* This neighborhood possesses many MTA bus lines, however, aside from the Melrose Station, no train service is directly available to the residents. 
* Citibike would allow residents to utilize a transportation service other than the existing MTA bus routes to travel to other areas within the neighborhood or other MTA connections. 
 
##### Port Morris 
* Port Morris is an industrial neighborhood in the South Bronx.
* Most CitiBike locations were selected based on proximity to schools, stores, bus stops, event venues, and major intersections.
* The addition of CitiBike service to this neighborhood would improve transit, as there are very few bus stops and no subway stops

* It has a population of 3525, and is 52.9% female.
* 24.4% of the population is between the ages of 25 and 34.
* 72.3% of the neighborhood is Hispanic and Latinx Americans
* Port Morris is 474 acres large.

* CitiBikes in Port Morris would make transportation across the neighborhood safer and faster.
* The neighborhood is surrounded by many major roads and bridges, so CitiBikes would be a safer form of trasnportation than walking.
* There is very little public transport in the neighborhood, so CitiBikes will make travel in the neighborhood faster, and make it easier to reach mass transit to travel outside the neighborhood.
* There are some locations where CitiBikes would not be as useful, for example, the various unpaved roads and areas that are mostly shipping centers and warehouses.
 
##### Project Beginnings and Goals
 
Each team member was assigned to an individual neighborhood in the South Bronx. Using Google Maps, we each took a screenshot of our neighborhood. Using Python, we highlighted the area around our neighborhood and layered a grid over our screenshot. Each square within the grid represents 1,000 square feet of area. 

The goal of our project was to propose two station locations for each region and depict our choices through various methods such as folium maps in Python and GeoJson.

##### Use of GeoJson

Each team member created their own geojson map, with a plot of first (green) and second (yellow) choices for CitiBike station locations. On our individual maps, the region of our neighborhood was marked with a polygon, and subway lines were shown with green/red lines. We then committed our geojsons to Github, and embedded them to our own website pages. 
Below is a merged version of all of our CitiBike proposed locations as one GeoJson map:
