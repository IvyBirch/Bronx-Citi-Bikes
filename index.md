 ###The Bronx
 ####Ivy Birchall, Yusef Wray, Casey Walsh

Each of these individual sites repersents a group members work on a specific neighborhood in the Bronx, explaining what CitiBike stations they reccomend and why they reccomend them. Each team member conducted their own individual research on their own neighborhood, and used GeoJson to create a map with color coded markers for their first and second choices for CitiBike loctions within a 1,000 square foot grid. Together, they cover the South Bronx neighborhoods and what CitiBike expansion may look like.

 #####Project beginings and goals
 
 Each team member was assigned a individual neighborhood in the South Bronx. Using Google Maps, we each took a screenshot of our neighborhood highlighted. Using Python, we highlighted the area around our neighborhood, and layered a grid over our screenshot. The grid is meant to represent 1,000 square feet. 
 The goal of our project is to propose two locations for CitiBikes every 1,000 square feet, and be able to depict our choices through various methods like folium maps in Python and GeoJson. 
 
 Examples of our hgihlighted maps and grid maps:
